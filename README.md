# PersonalWebsite
This is my old website so show off my game portfolio. 
It was completely overdesigned and I ended up making a simplier one, because I was being spammed by bots. 

I created a login/admin system to allow people to live chat with me. 
It would send me a discord notification if they used the live chat or an email and a notification if they used that. 
I used Node.js, Express, MongdoDB, and Bootstrap.
